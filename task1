  <h4><b><u>Productivity and meditation techinques</u></b></h4>
  <p>Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique to train attention and awareness and detach from reflexive, "discursive thinking" achieving a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state, while not judging the meditation process itself.[note 2]

    Techniques are broadly classified into focused (or concentrative) and open monitoring methods. Focused methods involve attention to specific objects like breath or mantras, while open monitoring includes mindfulness and awareness of mental events.
    
    Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions, though it is also practised independently from any religious or spiritual influences for its health benefits. The earliest records of meditation are found in the Upanishads, and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism.[5] Meditation-like techniques are also known in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, in the context of remembrance of and prayer and devotion to God.</p>

    <p>Good mental health enables us to handle stress, relate to others, and make choices that contribute to our overall well-being. It’s about more than just the absence of mental illnesses; it’s a state of balance where we can realize our potential, work productively, and contribute to our community</p>
